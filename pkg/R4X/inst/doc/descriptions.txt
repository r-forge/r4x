This package contains five functions. read.FASTA reads in a
FASTA-format alignment file and parses it into a data frame. read.CX reads
in a ClustalX .aln-format file and parses it into a data frame. read.Gdoc
reads in a GeneDoc .msf-format file and parses it into a data frame. The
alignment data frame returned by each of these functions has the sequence
IDs as the row names and each site in the alignment is a column in the data
frame. The program aaMI calculates the mutual information between each pair
of sites (columns) in the protein sequence alignment data frame. The
program aaMIn calculates the normalized mutual information between pairs of
sites in the protein sequence alignment data frame. The normalized mutual
information of sites i and j is the mutual information of these sites
divided by their joint entropy.

Amelia II "multiply imputes" missing data in a single cross-section
(such as a survey), from a time series (like variables collected for
each year in a country), or from a time-series-cross-sectional data
set (such as collected by years for each of several countries).
Amelia II implements our bootstrapping-based algorithm that gives
essentially the same answers as the standard IP or EMis approaches,
is usually considerably faster than existing approaches and can
handle many more variables.  Unlike Amelia I and other statistically
rigorous imputation software, it virtually never crashes (but please
let us know if you find to the contrary!).  The program also
generalizes existing approaches by allowing for trends in time series
across observations within a cross-sectional unit, as well as priors
that allow experts to incorporate beliefs they have about the values
of missing cells in their data.  Amelia II also includes useful
diagnostics of the fit of multiple imputation models.  The program
works from the R command line or via a graphical user interface that
does not require users to know R.

This package was born to release the TAO robust neural network algorithm to the R users. It has grown and I think it can be of interest for the users wanting to implement their own training algorithms as well as for those others whose needs lye only in the "user space".

This software is used in two situations. The first is to predict the next outcome based on the previous states of a discrete sequence. The second is to classify a discrete response  based on a number of discreate covariates. In both situations, we use Bayesian logistic regression models that consider the high-order interactions. The time arising from using high-order interactions is reduced greatly by our compression technique that represents a group of original parameters as a single one in MCMC step. In this version, we use log-normal prior for the hyperparameters. When it is used for the second situation --- classification, we consider the full set of interaction patterns up to a specified order.

Change in length of hospital stay (LOS) is frequently used to assess the impact and the costs of hospital-acquired complications. In order to compute the attributable change in LOS, it is crucial to account for the timing of events: A complication can only have an effect on LOS, once it has occured. These temporal dynamics can be adequately handled by multistate models; however, there is few software for such models available. We introduce an R-package "changeLOS" for computing change in LOS based on methods described in Schulgen and Schumacher (1996). We will illustrate the program on data from a prospective cohort study on hospital-acquired infections. Main features of the R-package "changeLOS" are R-methods to: (1) describe the multi-state model. (2) compute the Aalen-Johansen estimator for the matrix of transition probabilities P(u-, u) for all observed transition times u.(3) compute the Aalen-Johansen estimator for the matrix of transition probabilities P(s,t); the estimator is a finite matrix product of matrices P(u-,u) for every observed event time in the interval(s,t]. (4) visualize the temporal dynamics of the data, illustrated by transition probabilities. (5) compute and visualize change in LOS. (6) compute bootstrap variances for change in LOS.

Circular Statistics, from "Topics in circular Statistics" (2001) S. Rao Jammalamadaka and A. SenGupta, World Scientific.

The 'cir' package provides a documented version of the well-known isotonic regression (IR) algorithm (function 'pava'), and an improvement to IR in case the true function is known to be smooth and strictly monotone. This improvement called Centered Isotonic Regression (CIR) is available via the function 'cir.pava'. Additionally, the function 'cir.upndown' provides percentile estimation for dose-response experiments (e.g., ED50 estimation of a medication) using CIR.

Clust Along Chromosomes, a method to call gains/losses in CGH array data

Construct directed graphs of S4 class hierarchies and
visualize them.  Typically, these graphs are DAGs (directed acyclic
graphs) in general, though often trees.

Given $p$-dimensional training data containing $d$ groups (the design space), a classification algorithm (classifier) predicts which group new data belongs to.  Generally the input to these algorithms is high dimensional, and the boundaries between groups will be high dimensional and perhaps curvilinear or multi-faceted. This package implements methods for understanding the division of space between the groups.  See \url{http://had.co.nz/classifly} for more details.

This package can be used for clustering data with spatial information. Try function GUIspatClust() to run the clustTool GUI.

The selection method uses either a greedy search or headlong search. The greedy search at each step either checks all variables not currently included in the set of clustering variables singly for inclusion into the set or checks all variables in the set of clustering variables singly for exclusion.The headlong search only checks until a variable is included or excluded (i.e. does not necessarily check all possible variables for inclusion/exclusion at each step) and any variable with evidence of clustering below a certain level at any stage is removed from consideration for the remainder of the algorithm. Each variable's evidence for being useful to the clustering given the currently selected clustering variables is given by the difference between the BIC for the model with clustering (allowed to vary over 2 to a maximum number of groups and any of the different covariance parameterizations allowed in mclust) using the set of clustering variables including the variable being checked and the sum of BICs for the model with clustering (allowed to vary over 2 to a maximum number of groups and any of the different covariance parameterizations allowed in mclust) using the set of clustering variables without the variable being checked and the model for the variable being checked being conditionally independent of the clustering given the other clustering variables (this is modeled as a regression of the variable being checked on the other clustering variables).

Measures of concordance and reliability

The four functions svdcp (cp for column partitioned), svdbip or
svdbip2 (bip for bi-partitioned), and svdbips (s for a simultaneous
optimization of one set of r solutions), correspond to a "SVD by
blocks" notion, by supposing each block depending on relative
subspaces, rather than on two whole spaces as usual SVD does. The
other functions, based on this notion, are relative to two column
partitioned data matrices x and y defining two sets of subsets xi and
yj of variables and amount to estimate a link between xi and yj for
the pair (xi, yj) relatively to the links associated to all the other
pairs.

This small library contains a series of simple tools for
constructing and manipulating confounded and fractional
factorial designs. To some extent these complement those

for inferring the covariance matrix.  The estimator is statistically
highly accurate and efficient, applicable to "small n, large p" data,
and always returns a positive definite and well-conditioned matrix.

computationally cheap. In addition to covariance estimation the
package contains similar functions for inferring variances, correlations,
partial correlations, partial variances, and regression coefficients.
Furthermore, it provides  functions for fast SVD computation, for computing
the pseudoinverse, for checking the rank and positive definiteness of a
matrix, and for the computationally fast inversion of the covariance
and correlation matrix.

This package carries out Empirical Bayes thresholding
using the methods developed by I. M. Johnstone and B. W. Silverman.
The basic problem is to estimate a mean vector given a vector of observations of the
mean vector plus white noise, taking advantage of possible sparsity in the mean vector.
Within a Bayesian formulation, the elements of the mean vector are modelled as having,
independently, a distribution that is a mixture of an atom of probability at zero and
a suitable hevay-tailed distribution.
The mixing parameter can be estimated by a marginal maximum likelihood approach.
This leads to an adaptive thresholding approach on the original data.
Extensions of the basic method, in particular to wavelet thresholding, are also
implemented within the package.

either the Expectation-Maximization algorithms (for likelihood
models) or the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms (for Bayesian
models).  For all models, the individual-level data can be directly

provides a functionality which allows one to quantify the effect of data
aggregation on parameter estimation and hypothesis testing under the

an R package for exploratory data analysis

Data and functions for the book "Multivariate Statistical
Modelling Based
on Generalized Linear Models", version 1, by
Ludwig Fahrmeir and Gerhard Tutz

This package estimates factor analysis models using a genetic algorithm, which  makes opens up a number of new ways to pursue old ideas, such as those discussed by Allen  Yates in his 1987 book Multivariate Exploratory Data Analysis. The major sources of value added in this package are new ways to transform factors in exploratory factor analysis, and perhaps more importantly, a new estimator for the factor analysis model called semi-exploratory factor analysis.

Includes FAME storage and retrieval function, as well as functions and S3 classes for time indexes and time indexed series, which are compatible with FAME frequencies.

Books are "Practical Regression and ANOVA in R" on CRAN, "Linear Models with R" published in August 2004 by CRC press and "Extending the Linear Model with R" published by CRC press in December 2005.

Flat file database designed for large vectors and multi-dimensional arrays

This package performs general linear modeling with multiple
responses (MANCOVA).  An overall p-value for each model term is calculated
by the 50-50 MANOVA method, which handles collinear responses.  Rotation
testing is used to compute adjusted single response p-values according to
familywise error rates and false discovery rates.

Bi-variate data fitting is done by two ingredients: the margins and the dependency structure. The dependency structure is modeled through a copula. An algorithm was implemented considering seven families of copulas  (Generalized Archimedean Copulas), the best fitting can be obtained looking all copula's options. Different dependence's kind was considered (totally positive of order 2 and stochastically increasing).

This package contains functions to manipulate binary fingerprints
of arbitrary length. A fingerprint is represented by an object of S4 class 'fingerprint'
which is internally represented a vector of integers, such
that each element represents the position in the fingerprint that is set to 1.
The bitwise logical functions in R are overridden so that they can be used directly
with 'fingerprint' objects. A number of distance metrics are also
available (many contributed by Michael Fadock). Fingerprints
can be converted to Euclidean vectors (i.e., points on the unit hypersphere)i and
can also be folded using XOR.  Arbitrary fingerprint formats can be handled via line
handlers. Currently handlers are provided for CDK, MOE and BCI fingerprint data.

This small collection of functions provides distinctive graphics for display of anova
results. The two principal functions are granova.1w (a graphic for one way anova) and
granova.2w (a corresponding graphic for two way anova). These functions were written to display
data for any number of groups, regardless of their sizes (however, very large data sets or numbers of
groups are likely to be problematic). For these two functions a specialized approach is used
to construct data-based contrast vectors with respect to which anova data are displayed.
The result is that the graphics use straight lines, and flat surfaces, to help ensure clear
interpretations while being faithful to the standard effect tests in anova; the graphic
results are complementary to standard summary tables for these two basic kinds of analysis of variance.
Two additional functions are granova.ds (for comparing two dependent samples of data), and granova.contr
(which provides graphic displays for a priori contrasts). All functions provide relevant
numerical results to supplement the graphic displays of anova data.
The graphics based on these functions are aimed at students and non-statistician analysts; but they can
be generally helpful for identifying outliers, clusters, trends or the role of non-linear
transformations of data. In the case of granova.1w and granova.ds especially, several arguments have been
provided to facilitate construction of graphics that accommodate diverse features of data, and their
corresponding display requirements.

gsubfn is like gsub but can take a replacement function
or proto object rather than a replacement string.  Matches and
back references are input to the function and replaced by the
function output.  In the case of a proto object the object is

gsubfn can be used to split strings based on content rather than
delimiters and for quasi-perl-style string interpolation. The
package also has facilities for translating formulas to functions
and allowing such formulas in function calls instead of functions.
This can reduce code size and improve clarity when using apply,
lapply, optim, integrate, xyplot and any other function that
expects another function as an input argument.  gsubfn also
provides for quasi-perl string interpolation in arguments
of any existing R function.

HighProbability provides a simple, fast, reliable solution to the multiple testing problem. Given a vector of p-values or achieved significance levels computed using standard frequentist inference, HighProbability determines which ones are low enough that their alternative hypotheses can be considered highly probable. The p-value vector may be determined using existing R functions such as t.test, wilcox.test, cor.test, or sample. HighProbability can be used to detect differential gene expression and to solve other problems involving a large number of hypothesis tests.

This package performs a homogeneity analysis, aka a multiple correspondence
analysis, but with many additional options. Variables can be grouped into
sets, in order to emulate regression analysis and canonical analysis. For
each variable rank constraints on the category and quantifications (or transformations) and level constraints (which allows one to treat a variable as nominal, ordinal, or numerical) can be imposed.

The HOPACH clustering algorithm builds a hierarchical tree
of clusters by recursively partitioning a data set, while ordering
and possibly collapsing clusters at each level. The algorithm uses
the Mean/Median Split Silhouette (MSS) criteria to identify the
level of the tree with maximally homogeneous clusters. It also runs
the tree down to produce a final ordered list of the elements. The
non-parametric bootstrap allows one to estimate the probability that
each element belongs to each cluster (fuzzy clustering).

Computation on micro-arrays

When testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously,
this package provides functionality to calculate a lower bound for the
number of correct rejections (as a function of the number of rejected
hypotheses), which holds simultaneously -with high probability- for all
possible number of rejections.
As a special case, a lower bound for the total number of false null
hypotheses can be inferred.
Dependent test statistics can be handled for multiple tests of
associations. For independent test statistics, it is sufficient to
provide a list of p-values.

It contains routines for handling various types of set functions such as games or capacities. It can be used to compute several non-additive integrals: the Choquet integral, the Sugeno integral, and the symmetric and asymmetric Choquet integrals.

Kappalab further contains seven capacity identification routines: three least squares based approaches, a method based on linear programming, a maximum entropy like method based on variance minimization, a minimum distance approach and an unsupervised approach grounded on parametric entropies. The functions contained in Kappalab can for instance be used in the framework of multicriteria decision making or cooperative game theory.

The likelihood linkage analysis is a general agglomerative
hierarchical clustering method developed in France by Lerman in
a long series of research articles and books. Initially
proposed in the framework of variable clustering, it has been
progressively extended to allow the clustering of very general
object descriptions. The approach mainly consists in replacing
the value of the estimated similarity coefficient by the
probability of finding a lower value under the hypothesis of
'absence of link'. The package LLAhclust contains routines for
computing various types of probablistic similarity coefficients
between variables or object descriptions. Once the similarity
values between variables/objects are computed, a hierarchical
clustering can be performed using several probabilistic and
non-probabilistic aggregation criteria, and indices measuring
the quality of the partitions compatible with the resulting
hierarchy can be computed.

This is a new framework in which graph-structured data are used to train a classifier in a latent space, and then classify new nodes. During the learning phase, a latent representation of the network is first learned and a supervised classifier is then built in the learned latent space. In order to classify new nodes, the positions of these nodes in the learned latent space are estimated using the existing links between the new nodes and the learning set nodes.  It is then possible to apply the supervised classifier to assign each new node to one of the classes.

Some improved procedures for linear mixed models

The package implements the statistical theory of L-moments including
L-moment estimation, probability-weighted moment estimation, parameter estimation
for numerous familiar and not-so-familiar distributions, and L-moment estimation
for the same distributions from the parameters. L-moments are derived from the
expectations of order statistics and are linear with respect to the probability-
weighted moments. L-moments are directly analogous to the well-known product
moments; however, L-moments have many advantages including unbiasedness,
robustness, and consistency with respect to the product moments. This package
is oriented around the FORTRAN algorithms of J.R.M. Hosking, and the
nomenclature for many of the functions parallels that of the Hosking library.
However, numerous extensions are made to aid in expand of the breadth and ease
of L-moment application. Much theoretical extension of L-moment theory has
occurred in recent years. E.A.H. Elamir and A.H. Seheult have developed the
trimmed L-moments, which are implemented in this package. Further, recent
developments by Robert Serfling and Peng Xiao have extended L-moments into
multivariate space; the so-called sample L-comoments are implemented here. The
supported distributions with moment type shown as L (L-moments) or TL (trimmed
L-moments) and additional support for right-tail censoring ([RC]) include:
Cauchy(TL), Exponential(L), Gamma(L), Generalized Extreme Value(L),
Generalized Lambda(L & TL), Generalized Logistic (L), Generalized Normal(L),
Generalized Pareto(L[RC] & TL), Gumbel(L), Normal(L), Kappa(L),
Pearson Type III(L), Reverse Gumbel(L[RC]), Wakeby(L), and Weibull(L).

The Lmoments package contains functions to estimate L-moments and trimmed L-moments from the data.
The package also contains functions to estimate the parameters of the normal polynomial quantile mixture and
the Cauchy polynomial quantile mixture from L-moments and trimmed L-moments.

such that L(phi) = sum_{i=1}^n W(i)*phi(X(i)) - int_{X(1)}^{X(n)} exp(phi(x)) dx is maximal, for some
weights W(1), ..., W(n) s.t. sum_{i=1}^n W(i) = 1. According to the results in Duembgen and Rufibach (2006),
this function phi maximizes the ordinary log-likelihood sum_{i=1}^n W(i)*phi(X(i))
under the constraint that phi is concave. The corresponding  function exp(phi) is a log-concave probability density.
Two algorithms are offered: An active set algorithm and one based on the pool-adjacent-violaters algorithm.

The basic idea of latent semantic analysis (LSA) is,
that text do have a higher order (=latent semantic) structure which,
however, is obscured by word usage (e.g. through the use of synonyms

via a truncated singular value decomposition (a two-mode factor analysis)
over a given document-term matrix, this variability problem can be overcome.

to contain the unobservable realizations of (X,Y). We
compute the MLE based on such a set of rectangles.
The methods can also be used for univariate censored data (see data set
'cosmesis'), and for
censored data with competing risks (see data set 'menopause').
We also provide functions to visualize the observed data and the MLE.

non-Monte Carlo method.

MNP is a publicly available R package that fits the Bayesian
multinomial probit model via Markov chain Monte Carlo. The
multinomial probit model is often used to analyze the discrete
choices made by individuals recorded in survey data. Examples where
the multinomial probit model may be useful include the analysis of
product choice by consumers in market research and the analysis of
candidate or party choice by voters in electoral studies.  The MNP
software can also fit the model with different choice sets for each
individual, and complete or partial individual choice orderings of
the available alternatives from the choice set. The estimation
is based on the efficient marginal data augmentation algorithm that
is developed by Imai and van Dyk (2005). "A Bayesian Analysis of
the Multinomial Probit Model Using the Data Augmentation," Journal
of Econometrics, Vol. 124, No. 2 (February), pp. 311-334. Detailed
examples are given in Imai and van Dyk (2005). "MNP: R Package for
Fitting the Multinomial Probit Model." Journal of Statistical Software,
Vol. 14, No. 3 (May), pp. 1-32.

This package provides estimators of the mode of univariate unimodal data or univariate unimodal distributions. It also enables to compute the Chernoff distribution.

Given independent and identically distributed observations X(1), ..., X(n) from a density f,
this package provides five methods to perform a multiscale analysis about f as well as the necessary critical
values. The first method, introduced in Duembgen and Walther (2006), provides simultaneous confidence statements
for the existence and location of local increases (or decreases) of f, based on all intervals I(all) spanned by
any two observations X(j), X(k). The second method approximates the latter approach by using only a subset of
I(all) and is therefore computationally much more efficient, but asymptotically equivalent. Omitting the additive
correction term Gamma in either method offers another two approaches which are more powerful on small scales and
less powerful on large scales, however, not asymptotically minimax optimal anymore. Finally, the block procedure is a
compromise between adding Gamma or not, having intermediate power properties. The latter is again asymptotically
equivalent to the first and was introduced in Rufibach and Walther (2007).

A collection of tools to deal with statistical models.
The functionality is experimental and the user interface is likely to

of this proposal. Contributions are more than welcome!

transformations estimated from bootstrap samples drawn from K.

Release 1.2 (2005-01-24) adds better support for character variables, and miscellaneous
bug fixes.  Release 1.3 (2005-03-27) is for miscellaneous bug fixes, and improves the
documentation.  Release 1.4 (2005-06-27) improves the efficiency, and adds small bug
fixes.  Release 1.5 (2006-02-27) adds support for byte variables, plus small bug fixes.
Release 1.6 (2006-06-19) adds various bug fixes, plus support for making dimensions
WITHOUT dimvars (coordinate variables), although I think this is a bad
idea in general.  ALSO, the default behavior for put.var.ncdf with unlimited variables
and NO specified start and count parameters has changed!  Before, the default was
to append to the end of the existing variable.  Now, the default is to assume
a start of 1 along each dimension, and a count of the current length of each
dimension.  This really can be ambiguous when using an unlimited dimension.
I always specify both start and count when writing to a variable with an unlimited
dimension, and suggest you do as well.  I make require this in a future release,
as it seems to cause people problems.

conducted at the Pacific Biological Station (PBS) in Nanaimo,
British Columbia, Canada. It extends the R language to include
two-dimensional plotting features similar to those commonly
available in a Geographic Information System (GIS).  Embedded
C code speeds algorithms from computational geometry, such as
finding polygons that contain specified point events or
converting between longitude-latitude and Universal Transverse
Mercator (UTM) coordinates.  It includes data for a global

to the Tcl/Tk package, a user does not need to know Tcl/Tk. The
package contains examples that illustrate models built with other R
packages, including PBS Mapping, odesolve, ddesolvem, and BRugs.
It also serves as a convenient prototype for building new R packages,
along with instructions and batch files to facilitate that process.

This software is used to predict the binary response based on high dimensional features, for example gene expression data. The data are modelled with Bayesian naive Bayes models. When a large number of features are available, one may like to select only a subset of features to use, typically those features strongly correlated with the response in training cases. Such a feature selection procedure is however invalid since the relationship between the response and the features will appear stronger. This package provides a way to avoid this bias and yields well-calibrated prediction for the test cases.

QCAGUI is a graphical user interface (GUI) for the QCA package, derived from R Commander. Because QCA has little to do with statistics, the menus from Rcmdr were stripped down to the very basics. In crisp sets QCA, data is binary therefore it is fairly decent to treat it as categorical (1 - presence; 0 - absence). In order to ease the primary analysis (e.g. tables of frequencies) and the creation of basic graphs, this package activates some menus that are not available in Rcmdr but for factors. Users should be aware, however, that QCAGUI is not a package for statistics; Rcmdr is better for this purpose

The next versions of this algorithm will be oriented towards multi-value and fuzzy-set functions. Also, in the near future the current functions will deal with missing values in the data in order to perform simplifying assumptions

A package of robust methods.

ROC graphs, sensitivity/specificity curves, lift charts,
and precision/recall plots are popular examples of trade-off
visualizations for specific pairs of performance measures. ROCR is a
flexible tool for creating cutoff-parametrized 2D performance curves
by freely combining two from over 25 performance measures (new
performance measures can be added using a standard interface).
Curves from different cross-validation or bootstrapping runs can be
averaged by different methods, and standard deviations, standard
errors or box plots can be used to visualize the variability across
the runs. The parametrization can be visualized by printing cutoff
values at the corresponding curve positions, or by coloring the
curve according to cutoff. All components of a performance plot can
be quickly adjusted using a flexible parameter dispatching
mechanism. Despite its flexibility, ROCR is easy to use, with only
three commands and reasonable default values for all optional
parameters.

This package will read (and, as of version 1.1, write) TIFF format images and return them as a pixmap object. Because the resulting object can be very large for even modestly sized TIFF images, images can be reduced as they are read for improved performance.  This package is a wrapper around libtiff (www.libtiff.org), on which it depends (i.e. the libtiff shared library must be on your PATH for the binary to work, and tiffio.h must be on your system to build the package from source).  By using libtiff's highlevel TIFFReadRGBAImage function, this package inherently support a wide range of image formats and compression schemes.  This package also provides an implementation of the Ridler Autothresholding algorithm for easy generation of binary masks.

Multiple cluster location and detection for 2D and 3D spatial point patterns (case event data). The methodology of this package is based on an original method that allows the detection of multiple clusters of any shape. A selection order and the distance from its nearest neighbour once pre-selected points have been taken into account are attributed at each point. This distance is weighted by the expected distance under the uniform distribution hypothesis. Potential clusters are located by modelling the multiple structural change of the distances on the selection order. Their presence is tested using the double maximum test and a Monte Carlo procedure. The main function of this R package is "clus".

stochasticGEM is a publicly available package that
implements Bayesian inference for partially observed stochastic
epidemics. The general epidemic model is used for estimating

times individuals are detected, usually via appearance of symptoms.
The stochasticGEM package fits several variants of the general
epidemic model, namely the stochastic SIR with Markovian and
nonMarkovian infectious periods. The estimation is based on Markov chain
Monte Carlo algorithm.

Zero-coupon yield curves and spread curves are important inputs for various financial models, e.g. pricing of securities, risk management, monetary policy issues. Since zero-coupon rates are rarely directly observable, they have to be estimated from market data. The literature broadly distinguishes between parametric and spline-based estimation methods for the zero-coupon yield curve.

Inferences about counterfactuals are essential for prediction,
answering what if questions, and estimating causal effects.
However, when the counterfactuals posed are too far from the data at
hand, conclusions drawn from well-specified statistical analyses
become based largely on speculation hidden in convenient modeling
assumptions that few would be willing to defend.  Unfortunately,
standard statistical approaches assume the veracity of the model
rather than revealing the degree of model-dependence, which makes this
problem hard to detect.  WhatIf offers easy-to-apply methods to
evaluate counterfactuals that do not require sensitivity testing over
specified classes of models.  If an analysis fails the tests offered
here, then we know that substantive inferences will be sensitive to at
least some modeling choices that are not based on empirical evidence,
no matter what method of inference one chooses to use.  WhatIf
implements the methods for evaluating counterfactuals discussed in
Gary King and Langche Zeng, 2006, "The Dangers of Extreme
Counterfactuals," Political Analysis 14 (2); and Gary
King and Langche Zeng, 2007, "When Can History Be Our Guide?  The
Pitfalls of Counterfactual Inference," International Studies

Zelig is an easy-to-use program that can estimate, and
help interpret the results of, an enormous range of
statistical models. It literally is "everyone's statistical

with infrastructure that facilitates the use of any existing
method, such as by allowing multiply imputed data for any
model, and mimicking the program Clarify (for Stata) that
takes the raw output of existing statistical procedures and
translates them into quantities of direct interest.
